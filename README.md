# Exploratory Data Analysis on Used Cars Dataset

## Overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis of a used cars dataset to understand the factors that influence car pricing and demand. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations to uncover insights about car brands, engine size, mileage, and other specifications.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains details about various used cars, including:
- Car Name & Brand
- Year of Manufacture
- Mileage
- Engine Capacity
- Power Output
- Number of Seats
- Price

---

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values
   - Removed duplicates
   - Dropped unnecessary columns  

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracted brand name from car model
   - Converted engine and power into numeric formats
   - Standardized mileage values  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Univariate Analysis:** Distribution of mileage, engine capacity, prices, etc.  
   - **Bivariate Analysis:** Relationship between price and other features like mileage, power, brand.  
   - **Multivariate Analysis:** Combined effect of multiple features on car pricing.

## Visualizations
- Bar charts, histograms, and boxplots for distribution analysis  
- Scatter plots to study relationships  
- Correlation heatmaps for feature impact

##  Key Insights
- Engine size and power strongly influence car price.  
- Premium brands show higher resale values even with lower mileage.  
- Mileage has a negative correlation with price, but brand reputation can override this.  
- Cars with more seats and higher power are priced significantly higher.
